# Modeling and Analysis of London Crimes Dataset

The project contains my academic work for the project of "Big Data Analytics". 
The task required the following

* Understanding of [London Crimes Dataset](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/recorded_crime_summary).
* Modeling and Validation
* Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

As per project requirements, the codes and plots are in IPython Notebook files, in the following order:

* [Abstract Data Understanding.ipynb](https://github.com/iabd/BDAProject/blob/master/Abstract%20data%20understanding.ipynb)
* [Modeling and Validation.ipynb](https://github.com/iabd/BDAProject/blob/master/Modeling%20and%20Validation.ipynb)
* [Time Series Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/iabd/BDAProject/blob/master/Time%20Series%20Analysis.ipynb)


#### Requirements

The code should run with usual libraries. Just to make sure, we could run the following command beforehand 

`$pip install pandas statsmodels numpy matplotlib`
